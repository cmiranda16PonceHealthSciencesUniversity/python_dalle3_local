# DALL-E 3 Image Generator Script

This Python script allows users to interact with OpenAI's DALL-E 3 API to generate images based on textual prompts. It prompts the user to enter a text, submits this text to the DALL-E 3 model, and if successful, returns the URL of the requested image.

## Important Note
The images generated by the DALL-E 3 API are typically available for a short period of time, approximately 15 minutes, before they are no longer accessible via the URL.

## Authentication
The OpenAI API uses API keys for authentication. Visit your [API Keys page](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to retrieve the API key you'll use in your requests.

## Features
